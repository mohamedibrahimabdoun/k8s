A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

    running a cluster storage daemon, such as glusterd, ceph, on each node.
    running a logs collection daemon on every node, such as fluentd or logstash.
    running a node monitoring daemon on every node, such as Prometheus Node Exporter, collectd, Datadog agent, New Relic agent, or Ganglia gmond.
